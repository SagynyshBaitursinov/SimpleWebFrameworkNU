# The SimpleWebFramework
from the lecture given by me to the ACM Student chapter, NU. 16.02.17

Thanks to Tair Sabirgaliev (@tsabirgaliev) for inspiration.

## To make the framework work:
* Have JDK 1.8 and Maven installed on your computer.
* Build the sstframework project with maven.
* Add sstframework jar to your local maven repository.
* Make sure that sstframework is included as a maven dependency when sstserver is built.
* Build simpleapp with maven.
* Run sstserver jar and provide location of simpleapp as a parameter to it.
* Enjoy
